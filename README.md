# ✨ 3D React Fiber Gallery ✨

Welcome to my **3D React Three Fiber Playground** project! 🚀  
This repository is an interactive workspace where you can explore 3D graphics experiments on the web using **React Three Fiber**. It's my first step in creating dynamic 3D experiences, enriched with numerous interactive elements.

It starts with a loader that transports you into a 3D scene, where you will explore models and looping animations, all designed to dynamically respond to user input and create a unique and engaging experience.

## 📚 Project Features

Explore a dynamic and interactive world with a series of 3D experiments designed to amaze you! Here's what you'll find:

- **✨ Epic Initial Loader**  
  A loading animation that immerses you into a 3D universe, anticipating the surprises ahead.

- **🌍 Infinite Repetitive Scene**  
  An endless landscape where objects move and reposition in a continuous loop, creating an uninterrupted flow.

- **💥 Mesh Explosions and Recomposition**  
  Scroll and watch as 3D models explode and recombine in real time, offering stunning visual effects.

- **🏠 3D Apartment Revealed Gradually**  
  A 3D apartment model that gradually reveals itself as you scroll, with every detail coming to life.

- **🌀 Interactive Cards (3D Portals)**  
  Three clickable cards that act as portals, transporting you to new and fascinating 3D worlds.

- **🎞️ 3D Slider Opening New Worlds**  
  An incredible 3D slider: each slide is a window into a parallel universe to explore.

- **🐕 Animated and Interactive Models**  
  Interact with a 3D dog and a woman! Trigger custom animations and watch the models come to life.

- **🚴‍♂️ 3D Bicycle with Animated Wheels**  
  A 3D bicycle model that dynamically responds to your input, with continuously moving wheels.
